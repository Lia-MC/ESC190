class Node:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.value = value



assume input given in this format (eg. list of lists where each list is a tuple with pixel values and name)
implenent 1 nearest neighbour algo to get smth abt pixels and name (32:15 ish)

compute hidden neuron and compute the values that make it the highest

sigma function if needed would be given



hiddenlayercompute:
W0
W1
W2
etc

then compute h 



adjacency list
matrix representation

priority queue struct - dont worry abt writing but need to know how to use
