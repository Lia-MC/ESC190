Question 4. [10 marks]
In C, write a function that takes in an array of integers and its size, and returns 1 if the array is strictly increasing (e.g., {1, 5, 10, 12}) and 0 otherwise (e.g., {1, 2, 2, 3} or {5, 4}). You must use recursion.
You must not use loops, global variables, or any helper functions.
