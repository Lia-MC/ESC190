// Question 5. [15 marks]
// Consider the 2D Integer Matrix Abstract Data Type. The 2D Matrix is a rectangular array of integers of
// size n × m. The operations are:
//  getElem(M, i, j): get element at location (i, j) of matrix M
//  Set element at location (i, j) of matrix M
//  Return a new matrix whose value is the sum of the matrices A and B
// Implement this ADT using the C programming language. Show how to use your implementation to compute
// Your implementation must allow the user to operate on matrices of any size. As long as you follow
// the specifications outlined in the question, you can make any choices you want and make any reasonable assumptions. Indicate which part of your code would go in which of the files main.c, matrix.c,
// matrix.h.
