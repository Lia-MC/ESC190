angle between them versus magnitude
magnitude can be a scale for the brightness
angle is what matters - how similar they are
dot product is used to compare similarity
high dot product, high cosine similarity, low angle, similar
conditions:
- images are the same size (scale or crop em)
- similar features should be aligned 
(eg. comparing someone's eyes and someone's mouth doesnt give info)

1 nearest neighbour algo
take an input and compute cosine similarity for everything in the training set
z1 is sum of the: x1 times weight between x1 and z1 + ... + xn times weight between xn and z1 
to find output i think you also need to add the b value
check slides + cross reference with the 3b1b vid
monotonic transformation (sigma)
for loop that computes the sum 
figuring out weights and b's -> adjust them
what's the role of b? weighting the accuracy???
w is the weight of each edge where each xi is an edge
z1 is high everything else is low if x is person 1
etc.
