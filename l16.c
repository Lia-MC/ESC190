// 2 pointer exercise questions
// lab 1 loops + arrays question (2 of these)
// sort array using qsort, syntax for qsort will be provided but know how to use it
// matching substr, strncmp versus strcmp
// recursion...?
// location of first/last occurence
// matching 
// file read in
// compute the average
// qsort (or compute max and find student that corresponds to max)
// if size of line is unlimited, fgets -> try to repeatedly do it and try with a large size number
// linked lists question
// abstract data types??
// need to know how to do labs + lecture examples
// isspace()
// fgets() reads in next line in file
// concept of memory leak or illegal access could be tested
